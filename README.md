_About:_
A simple web application built using Ruby on Rails, featuring a Wordle clone built from scratch. There is functionality for making and managing an account as well as storing and displaying stats from previous games. All HTML and CSS is mine aside from what is provided from Bootstrap and the official Wordle colors. All Javascript logic is mine as well.

_Application Info:_ 
Ruby - 3.1.2, Rails - 7.0.2.4, Database - PostgreSQL
